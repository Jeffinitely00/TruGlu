TruGlu is built for 2 main functionalities at this time;

1.) Display all cryptocurrency data
2.) Search through those coins with a search input

Steps and technologies used;

1.) Find API that tracks coin data
2.) Call API by using Axios library instead of useFetch
3.) useEffect to display coins when page renders
4.) useState to represent listOfCoins
5.) input text with map filter to filter coins in search

Unsolved problems;

1.) I wanted to display crypto market data in my header as a ticker tape
